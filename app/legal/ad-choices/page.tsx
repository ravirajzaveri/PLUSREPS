      <h1>Ad Choices Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 20, 2025</p>

      <p>
        At Fitverse, we use advertising to support the platform and provide relevant experiences to our users. This Ad Choices Policy explains how we use targeted advertising and how you can manage your preferences.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Personalized Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        We and our partners may use cookies, device identifiers, and other tracking technologies to deliver ads that are more relevant to your interests.
      </p>
      <p>Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Suggested fitness products based on workout streams you view</li>
        <li>Local health offers based on your general location</li>
        <li>Creators you may like based on your interaction history</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Data We Use for Ads</h2>
      <p>Advertising may be based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your Fitverse activity (e.g., streams watched, interactions)</li>
        <li>Device type and general location</li>
        <li>Your profile interests or demographic info (if provided)</li>
        <li>Third-party cookies and tracking pixels</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not share personally identifiable information with advertisers.</p>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Ad Partners</h2>
      <p>
        Some ads on Fitverse may be delivered by third-party ad networks. These networks may use their own tracking tools and cookies, subject to their privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Your Choices</h2>
      <p>You can manage ad preferences through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Ad Settings” in your Fitverse account (coming soon)</li>
        <li>
          Opt-out tools provided by: <br />
          <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YourAdChoices</a><br />
          <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Network Advertising Initiative</a>
        </li>
        <li>Your device and browser ad settings</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may still see ads, but they may be less relevant.</p>

      <h2>5. Children and Ads</h2>
      <p>
        We do not deliver targeted advertising to users under the age of 13 or where prohibited by law.
      </p>
